# 6.806/6.864 Final Project

Run main.py to train models for part 1 of the project.

Run part2.py to train models for part 2 of the project.

Note that the first time either main.py or part2.py is run, data such as embeddings and corpuses will be downloaded - it will take a while before any training actually happens.
